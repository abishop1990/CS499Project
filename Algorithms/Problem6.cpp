 *"The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 *
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *( 1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 *
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the

 *
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers 
 * and the square of the sum."
